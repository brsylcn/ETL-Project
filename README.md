# ETL Project (Group 2)

We are started gather all Kaggle repos we could find that had game related data. We ended up with 9 csv’s having various amounts of data in varying degrees of completeness. We eliminated one after the other until we settled on one with three files found in the Kaggle repo:https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-datasetThree files containing video game data.PS4_GamesSales.csvVideo_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csvXboxOne_GameSales.csvThe columns/data broke down as followsRangeIndex: 16719 entries, 0 to 16718Data columns (total 16 columns): #   Column           Non-Null Count  Dtype  ---  ------           --------------  -----   0   Name             16717 non-null  object  1   Platform         16719 non-null  object  2   Year_of_Release  16450 non-null  float64 3   Genre            16717 non-null  object  4   Publisher        16665 non-null  object  5   NA_Sales         16719 non-null  float64 6   EU_Sales         16719 non-null  float64 7   JP_Sales         16719 non-null  float64 8   Other_Sales      16719 non-null  float64 9   Global_Sales     16719 non-null  float64 10  Critic_Score     8137 non-null   float64 11  Critic_Count     8137 non-null   float64 12  User_Score       7590 non-null   float64 13  User_Count       7590 non-null   float64 14  Developer        10096 non-null  object  15  Rating           9950 non-null   object dtypes: float64(10), object(6)We are going to drop columns 10-15 from video game sales since the other files do not contain matching columns.We are going to create self-referencing columns for platform in both the Xbox and PS4.This will leave us with 10 columns in each dataframe.We then merged the 3 into one. We drop duplicates.We dropped NaN.That left us with XXXXX rows of data.We then started breaking the data down into the various normal forms
