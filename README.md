# ETL Project (Group 2)

We are started gather all Kaggle repos we could find that had game related data. We ended up with 9 csvâ€™s having various amounts of data in varying degrees of completeness. We eliminated one after the other until we settled on one with three files found in the Kaggle repo:

### Data Source:

https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset

Three files containing video game data.

- PS4_GamesSales.csv
- Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv
- XboxOne_GameSales.csv

The columns/data broke down as follows
